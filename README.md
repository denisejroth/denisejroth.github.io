# Personal Website — Denise J. Roth

Welcome to my personal academic website, built using GitHub Pages.  
It provides an overview of my research, publications, teaching, and ongoing projects in **political communication**, **science and media**, and **computational methods**.

You can find:
- A short biography and CV (with download link)  
- My current and forthcoming research output  
- Links to external profiles such as ORCID, GitHub, and Bluesky  

If you notice any issues, broken links, or accessibility problems, please open an issue in this repository — I appreciate your feedback.  
A **mobile-friendly update** with improved layout and navigation will follow soon!

## Acknowledgements & Theme Credits  

This site is adapted from **[hello](https://github.com/saragong/hello)**, a minimalist template for personal websites on GitHub Pages, originally created by **[Sara Gong](https://saragong.github.io/)** at the University of Southern California.  
The *hello* theme was designed to make GitHub Pages accessible for everyone — no Ruby environment, Jekyll setup, or coding experience required — and provides a simple single-page layout with customizable “about,” “portfolio,” and “call-to-action” sections.

**hello** itself is adapted from **[Twenty](https://html5up.net/twenty)**, a responsive theme by **HTML5 Up**, and uses clean Liquid and Markdown-based customization.
